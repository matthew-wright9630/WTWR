# React + Vite

## About the project

This website receives weather information for the current location, then provides suggestions on what clothing options to wear based on the temperature.

## Technologies Used

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were used to create the website, and Vite was used for the project template. The project was split into different components using React.
To get weather information, API calls to the Openweathermap.org were used.

## Requirements

For components to interact and work correctly, React is required.

Windows:
React can be downloaded using npm.

npm install react-router-dom@6

## Usage Instructions

To see the full functionality of the website, the project must be ran locally. A mock server will also need to be ran. The information for the mock server is found in the db.json file, which is in the root directory.
To run the website locally, call "npm run dev" in the terminal. It will run on LocalHost:3000 by default.

To run the mock server, the following command can be used: npm install -g json-server@^0
Note: some systems may require "Sudo" to be placed before the "npm" for elevated permissions.
